This app performs searches against the spaceX graphQL server
https://api.spacex.land/graphql/

The only external dependency is to the Apollo library, which is the standard 
swift library for graphql.

The dependency on graphQL is created using the Swift Package Manager.

The Apollo code is based on the introductory iOS tutorial:
